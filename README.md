# (Java FX) PathGraph

PathGraph fork based on SmartGraph is an adapted library to work with path graphs that uses nodes, edges and associated costs.
Provided to user-friendly interface in a stable user-experience in witch mange dynamically the path graphs.
Ability of find and show the shortest path, make screenshots and upload or download json of the graphs.

## GET STARTED

### 1. Path Graphs Logic

Provided to represent path graphs through nodes, edges, and associated costs with the following logic:

#### Edges can be directed:


Provided to represent path graphs through nodes, edges, and associated costs with the following logic:


```java
SmartGraphEdgeBase.DIRECTION_FIRST //Edge in the natural direction (with an arrow).
```

    
    
```java
SmartGraphEdgeBase.DIRECTION_SECOND //Edge in the opposite direction (with an arrow)
```
    
```java
SmartGraphEdgeBase.DIRECTION_BIDIRECTIONAL //Edge without direction (no arrow).
```


PathGraph is an adapted version of the [SmartGraph](https://github.com/brunomnsilva/JavaFXSmartGraph) library, developed to implement new user-experience features in a stable user-friendly interface.
